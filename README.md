iSavr
=====

iSavr is a small application that you can use to save files from an old-style iPod (one that doesn't run iOS) to a disk.

Usage
=====

Connect your iPod to your computer then open iSavr. When prompted, browse to the iTunesDB file located at the root of your iPod drive. iSavr will then read the contents of your iTunesDB - select the tracks you want to save then hit the "Save" button.

On the save dialog, choose a base directory and enter a file/directory mask. This mask is used to generate a file name based on metadata stored in your iPod's database. 

Click save and iSavr will copy the files from your iPod to your computer.
